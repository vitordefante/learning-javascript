In order to compare values in JavaScript we use the comparison operator "=="
It tries to convert the two values to a common type in order to compare only the values, giving less importante to it's type. Example:
'1' == 1 // true
true

Unlike the strict equality comparison "===" that does not try to convert the values to the same type. Example:

'1' === 1 // false

There are the inequality operator and it's strict version as well. They are respectively the logical opposite of the two operator previously mentioned. Examples:
Inequality operator:
1 != '1' // false
1 != 2 // true
1 != 3 // true
Strict inequality  operator:
1 !== '1' // true
...

One thing to note is that every comparison operator always return true or false.
