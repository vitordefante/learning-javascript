If you want to create a single use case function, or create one to serve as parameter to other functions, you can use an Arrow Function. A cleaner and more simple way to write a function, you don't even need to name it.

The common syntax for this case is this:

const myFunction = function() {
    const myName = "Josh";
    return myName;
}

With JavaScript ES6 we have the arrow function syntax:

const myFunction = () => {
    const myName = "Josh";
    return myName;
}

You can omit the keyword value if there is no function body, simplifying even more the code.
As the example:

const myFunction = () => "Josh";

More examples:

const myMultiplier = (num, mul) => num * mul;

myMultiplier(1, 2) should return 2.
