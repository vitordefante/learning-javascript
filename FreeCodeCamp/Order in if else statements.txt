A funcion is executed from top to bottom, the deveolper will want to be careful of what statement comes first, here is two examples:

function foo(x) {
    if (x < 1) {
        reutrn "Less than one."
    } 
    else if (x < 2) {
        return "Less than two."
    }
    else {
        reutrn "Greater than or equal two."
    }
} // This function will return less than one if 0 is the argument.

// In the next one, we'll just change the order of the statements.

function bar(x) {
    if (x < 2) {
        return "Less than two."
    }
    else if (x < 1) {
        return "Less than one."
    }
    else {
        return "Greater than or equal to two."
    } // This function will return less than two if 0 is the argument.
}

This happens because the first condition satisfied (that returns true) will be executed, and since it's a chain with else if (only one of the conditions will be executed when satisfied) the first one will be the only.
