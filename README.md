Documenting my JavaScript and web development learning process.

Welcome to my JavaScript Learning Repository! This repository serves as a documentation of my journey in learning JavaScript, where I store all the course files, small projects, and valuable learning notes, all **course related**, you can find any separated projects in **other repositories in my GitHub page**.

## 📁 Courses
Here are the course materials I have completed during my JavaScript learning. Each course includes its own set of exercises (**there are a LOT of practical exercises I made my own**) and examples that have helped me deepen my understanding of the language. Here are some of the courses I've completed so far:

1. [Curso em Video - JavaScript](https://github.com/vitordefante/learning-javascript/tree/main/Curso%20em%20Video%20-%20JavaScript) Was my very first contact with the language. I chose this course because the didatics of professor [Gustavo Guanabara](https://github.com/gustavoguanabara) are the best, super begginer-friendly and a lot of practical study that makes you really learn and catch the materials.
2. [freeCodecamp - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/vitordefante/learning-javascript/tree/main/FreeCodeCamp) A little more advanced and more reading than video. I chose this course based on freeCodeCamps's great reputation and since I have a good understanding on the english language I figured I could try this course even to sharpen it a little. You can find my certification [here 📜](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/fcc073b85b0-1438-4efc-98ed-0603e3608965/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures).
